# typed

Typed is a simple and pragmatic set of type wrappers for common Go use-cases. This aims to be simple
and usable in production code environments.

The Go team decided [_not to update libraries_] in 1.18 alongside the release of generics. I find this
to be the right move, and so this library aims to provide wrappers for common operations and types as
both an experiment in typing in Go 1.18+ and also a transitionary package.
